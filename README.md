# Formulation of an ML-based model for the Assessment of Maximum Sprint Capability in Elite Soccer Players

In recent years, machine learning techniques have gained widespread popularity, fueled by the availability of vast amounts of data across various industries. \newline
The sports industry, including football, has also embraced these techniques to gain a competitive edge.
In our work, we focus on estimating and analyzing the maximum acceleration capability of football players using tracking data, which defines the player’s position on the field at each frame. This information can contribute to more precise tactical preparation and personalized training strategies.
We develop a regression-based model that reconstructs a profile for each player, capturing the relationship between acceleration and speed during a maximum sprint when the athlete performs at their peak capability.
By applying this model to data sampled at regular intervals during a match, we can identify variations in the curves, which reflect changes in the player’s physical condition. It also allows us to evaluate how the time it takes for a player to cover specific distances at a certain initial speed varies over time.
Furthermore, we employ unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, to identify players with similar athletic characteristics and performance. This approach deepens our understanding of player capabilities and enables data-driven decision-making in sports analysis and training. It provides a deeper level of insight into player performance, facilitating effective player evaluation, team selection, and training program optimization.
